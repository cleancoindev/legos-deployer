# legos-deployer
Deploy most used defi protocols in the local setup by calling just a function

# Why?
Developing with multiple protocols is a crucial part of DeFi development, and currently none of the approaches are quite satisfactory.
It turns out there are three common approaches:
1. writing mock contracts
2. Forking off the mainnet
3. deploying the protocols locally

By wirting mock contracts, you might feel like you are developing protocol from the scratch and forking off mainnet is not yet bug-free and fast as we would like.
This package is going to help developers deploy the protocols locally.
